 ## üìå This is the 1st_project of 10 projects series in The Data Analysis Workshop Book by Packt :

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Motive : Analyzing data from bike sharing services 
,identifying usage patterns depending on time features and weather 
conditions. Furthermore, applying concepts such as visual analysis, 
hypothesis testing, and time series analysis to the available data. Finally,working with time series data and 
apply some of the main data analysis techniques to business scenarios.

### Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure : Chapter 1: Bike Sharing Analysis
**Understanding the Data :**

**Data Preprocessing**
- Preprocessing Temporal and Weather Features
- Registered versus Casual Use Analysis
- Analyzing Seasonal Impact on Rides

**Hypothesis Tests**
- Estimating Average Registered Rides
- Hypothesis Testing on Registered Rides

**Analysis of Weather-Related Features**
- Evaluating the Difference between the Pearson and Spearman Correlations.
- Correlation Matrix Plot

**Time Series Analysis**
- Time Series Decomposition in Trend, Seasonality, and Residual Components.

**ARIMA Models**
- ACF and PACF Plots for Registered Rides
- Investigating the Impact of Weather Conditions on Rides

**Summary :**
we studied a business problem related to bike sharing services. We 
started by presenting some of the main visual techniques in data analysis, such as 
bar plots, scatter plots, and time series visualizations. We also analyzed customer 
behaviors based on different time frames and weather conditions. We introduced the 
reader to hypothesis testing and some of its main applications. Finally, we presented 
the basics of time series analysis, and how to identify the best time series models 
when dealing with nonstationary time series.
